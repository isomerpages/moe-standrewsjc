<p>Many educators and philosophers concur that the ultimate goal of education
is to nurture thoughtful individuals with empathy, one who can make sound
decisions in both their personal and professional lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At SAJC, a Holistic Thinker is someone who exercises sound judgment by
considering the broader context, innovates to find practical solutions,
envisions the future, and prepares for it. The College’s framework for
Holistic Thinking encompasses four dimensions: Critical Thinking, Creative
Thinking, Caring Thinking, and Forward Thinking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Every lesson and activity in SAJC is purposefully designed with clear
objectives that incorporate and strengthen specific thinking skills.</p>
<h4><strong>Talent Development Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The Talent Development Programme (TDP) aims to stretch our Saints by cultivating
essential 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies, including information and
communication skills, critical and inventive thinking, civic literacy,
global awareness, and cross-cultural skills. This is achieved through a
range of opportunities designed to support growth across three key domains:
Scholastic Development, Servant Leadership Development, and Expanding Perspectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the TDP, Saints can expect to acquire knowledge and skills that
go beyond the GCE A-Level curriculum. To enrich and extend classroom learning,
Arts and Science students in the programme can participate in specialised
experiences offered through the Humanities Scholars Programme (HSP) and
the Science Scholars Programme (SSP) respectively. The table below outlines
some of the opportunities available under both programmes.</p>

<p>Saints in the TDP are also empowered with the skills and experiences needed
to face challenges with confidence, growing into Servant Leaders who can
appreciate and integrate multiple perspectives. Through the TDP experience,
our Saints are well-prepared and better positioned to pursue prestigious
scholarships in both the public and private sectors.</p>

<h4><strong>Global Experience Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>To strengthen students’ 21st century competencies and provide authentic
learning opportunities in a globalised world, SAJC offers a range of Global
Experience Programmes through its twinning partnerships with schools around
the world. These experiences are integral to nurturing our Saints as Holistic
Thinkers who are globally aware, adaptable, and grounded in their values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these programmes, we hope our Saints will:</p>

<p>Deepen their understanding of Singapore’s place within the regional and
