<p>International students seeking admission are to apply directly to the
college.&nbsp; As the examination system differs from country to country,
we will consider such applications on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; Interested
students should send in their cover letter and relevant education certificates
to <a href="mailto:sajc@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sajc@moe.edu.sg</a>
</p>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to submit J-PACT results for the college’s
consideration. If found suitable, the student may undergo an interview
process and take school-based placement tests.</p>
<p>We will consider the application for admission of international students
for 2026 JC1 admission AFTER the release of school posting of Joint Admission
Exercise. Applications by international students are evaluated based on
merit and are subject to the international students meeting the college’s
admission criteria and availability of vacancies.</p>
<p>Applicants are to submit their application via the link to appeal on our
college website by <strong>9 February 2026</strong>, and they will be contacted
only if shortlisted.</p>
