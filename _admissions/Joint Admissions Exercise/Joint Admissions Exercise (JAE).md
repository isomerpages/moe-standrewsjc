<p>Students with Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination Results may
apply for admission into the college via the Ministry of Education Joint
Admissions Exercise (JAE). The JAE is typically conducted in January after
the release of the Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination results.
The JAE is conducted in three phases:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Registration Phase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posting Phase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posting Results Release Phase</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on the JAE process can be found on the MOE Admissions
website.</p>
<p>Applicants seeking to gain admission into the college must meet the entry
criteria based on the L1R5 aggregate. This aggregate is calculated from
the results obtained in the previous year’s Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level
Examination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The L1R5 aggregate cut-off (after deduction of bonus points) based on
2026's Joint Admission Exercise is:</p>
