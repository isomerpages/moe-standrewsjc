<p><strong>2. Can I combine subjects from different streams?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The JC curriculum requires all students whatever JC they are in to offer
a contrasting subject. Therefore if you are in the science faculty you
would have to offer a contrasting subject from the arts or humanities.
Similarly, if you are in the arts faculty you would have to offer either
a science or mathematics subject. This provides you with a broad base of
learning and will prepare you more effectively for the multi-disciplinary
approaches that are being taken in university education. Check out the
subject combinations offered by SAJC <a href="/admissions/subject-combinations/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3. How many subjects do I have to do in JC?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Generally you would offer three H2 content based subjects and one H1 content
based subject. One of the four content based subjects must be from a contrasting
discipline. In addition you would do General Paper (GP), Mother Tongue
(MTL) at H1 level and Project Work (PW). Students who have done exceptionally
well in the GCE O level Exams may also apply to do four H2 subjects, on
top of GP, MTL and PW. Check for details on subject combinations offered
by SAJC <a href="/admissions/subject-combinations/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>4. I did Combined Sciences for my “O” levels. Can I take pure Science subjects at H2 level?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; However, if you did not offer pure science subjects at “O”
level, that is, pure Biology, Chemistry or Physics, you are strongly advised
to choose a combination that has only one science subject at H2 level.

<p><strong>5. I am opting for a combination with Arts and Humanities H2 subjects but also want to do Mathematics. Can I?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Check out Arts combinations offered by SAJC. Some H2 combinations do offer
H2 Mathematics. Students who offer these combinations are advised that
to cope with H2 Mathematics, they should have a strong background in Additional
Math at “O” level. Alternatively students may wish to opt for Mathematics
at H1 level as their contrasting subject. Check out the requirements for
specific subject combinations <a href="/admissions/subject-combinations/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>8. How should I decide what subjects to study in JC?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Generally you should study subjects you enjoy and have an interest in
as you will usually do well in such subjects. Do not go for what is popular
or what your friend has chosen. At SAJC we have a wide range of subjects
available. These provide a preparation for any subject course you may wish
to read at university. We also have an Education and Career Guidance team
and full-time counselors to advise you on your choices and advise you on
your options. We can also advise if you wish to continue your studies overseas.
