<h3>H3 Subjects</h3>
<p>H3 subjects have syllabi that are of much higher level difficulty. Students
offering H3 subjects must have the time and ability to manage workload
beyond their subject combination. A H3 subject must be offered together
with the corresponding subject at the H2 level.
<br>
<br>Students may offer H3 subjects in JC2 if they meet the following requirements
in their JC1 Promotional Examination:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Distinction in the subject they wish to pursue as H3,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimum of a B grade in all other H2 subjects, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pass in their H1 subject.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Students can apply for H3 subjects offered by one of the following MOE
partners involving tertiary institutions such as SMU, NUS or NTU.
<br>
<br>Alternatively, H3 subjects offered in SAJC include H3 Chemistry, H3 Mathematics,
H3 Physics, H3 Literature, H3 Geography and H3 History.
