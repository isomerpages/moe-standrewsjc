<p>Focusing on both mental and physical training, Ultimate Frisbee is a demanding
but rewarding sport. At Saints Ultimate (SAU), we do more than just throwing
a Frisbee around– we also learn to appreciate the physics behind the sport,
and what it means to be a good sportsman. Working together as a co-ed team,
SAU strongly believes in love, tenacity and chasing after excellence. Our
team aims to make Ultimate Frisbee a more recognised and loved sport in
Singapore. Carrying the motto “Learn, Laugh, Love”, we hope to make every
training enjoyable and enriching!</p>
<p>Training twice a week, SAU welcomes anyone who is willing to learn and
have a passion for Ultimate Frisbee. Remember, there is no SAU without
‘U’!</p>
