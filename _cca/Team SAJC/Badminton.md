</p>
<p>The SAJC Badminton Team aims to sharpen our skills consistently in order
to play competitively at any tournament. Our trainings focus on the following
aspects: footwork, fitness, speed, accuracy, strategies and control. We
emphasise on three core values that can be utilised outside the court too:
teamwork, sportsmanship, and resilience.</p>
<p>Through our rigorous training sessions and the bond we have with one another,
we hope to improve our skills, strengthen our value of sportsmanship and
promote team spirit! You’ll find us hard at work during training sessions
on Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>
