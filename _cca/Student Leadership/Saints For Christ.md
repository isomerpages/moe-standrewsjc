<p>Members of Saints For Christ (SFC) take on the role of spiritual leadership
in SAJC, where we focus on knowing Christ and making him known. The SFC
members meet on Wednesdays and Fridays, strengthening our leadership awareness
through Bible reading and discussions on how to better serve the College.
Looking outside of the core group, the SFC connects with the wider College
community through various initiatives. We organise termly VIA programmes,
arrange Thursday Morning Fellowship meetings, provide Morning Reflections,
and occasionally serve in the worship band during Chapel services. Additionally,
we hold events like Saints Fire and the Shine Your Light Interfaith Dialogue
to engage our fellow Saints. Together with our fellow student leadership
body, we contribute to the vibrancy of College life.</p>
