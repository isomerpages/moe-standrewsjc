<p>At the SAJC Concert Band, we believe that music-making should be enjoyable
and only then, would it be entertaining and uplifting for our audiences.
We know that by working together as a tight-knitted Band, we are growing
together both in our musical excellence and character. Being run in a self-directed
manner, we constantly develop as leaders of self and others, actively contributing
to the band with excellence, motivation and kindness.</p>
<p>Our performances, which feature our hard work to family and friends, include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>annual Concert</strong>,
either self-organised or as guest performers with our band alumni;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation; </strong>and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our<strong> Christmas Concert</strong> with
the wider Saints Andrew’s Village bands, uniting our Junior, Secondary,
JC and alumni bands in the spirit of “One Family Unbroken”.</p>
<p>We also use our musical skills to contribute to <strong>serve the wider community</strong>,
such as conducting workshops and programmes for others who are keen to
learn more about music.</p>
<p>The Band is conducted by our well-loved Conductor <strong>Mr Marvin Khoo</strong>,
who graduated from the Berklee College of Music in Boston, USA, with a
Bachelor of Music (Jazz Composition).</p>
<p><strong>CCA Timings:</strong>
