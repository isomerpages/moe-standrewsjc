</p>
<p>At the SAJC Concert Band, we believe that music-making should be enjoyable
and only then, would it be entertaining and uplifting for our audiences.
We know that by working together as a tight-knitted Band, we are growing
together both in our musical excellence and character. Being run in a self-directed
manner, we constantly develop as leaders of self and others, actively contributing
to the band with excellence, motivation and kindness.</p>
<p>Our performances, which feature our hard work to family and friends, include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>annual Concert</strong>,
either self-organised or as guest performers with our band alumni;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation; </strong>and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our<strong> Christmas Concert</strong> with
the wider Saints Andrew’s Village bands, uniting our Junior, Secondary,
JC and alumni bands in the spirit of “One Family Unbroken”.</p>
<p>We also use our musical skills to contribute to <strong>serve the wider community</strong>,
such as conducting workshops and programmes for others who are keen to
learn more about music.</p>
<p>The Band is conducted by our well-loved Conductor <strong>Mr Marvin Khoo</strong>,
who graduated from the Berklee College of Music in Boston, USA, with a
Bachelor of Music (Jazz Composition).</p>
<p><strong>CCA Timings:</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Full Band Practice on Mondays and Wednesdays, 3.30 – 7pm</strong>.
Closer to exam season, practice will end at 6pm.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Sectionals on Thursdays OR Fridays, 4-6pm (T1 &amp; T2 only). </strong>These
are conducted by<strong> </strong>specialized<strong> </strong>music tutors,
and held over a period of about 10 weeks from the end of Term 1 to the
middle of Term 2, to prepare band members for the upcoming Concert or SYF.</p>
<p>Note: At the end of each year, band members who are keen and proficient
at their instruments may sign up for the <strong>Arts Immersion Trip to Bangkok</strong>,
where they can go on an exchange &amp; joint performance with our partner
school, Triam Udom Suksa School.</p>
