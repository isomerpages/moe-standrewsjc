<p>The SAJC Dance Society is made up of dedicated members with a passion
for dance, and we aim to awe and inspire our audience with performances
ranging from elegant contemporary to vibrant hip-hop. We perform during
major College events such as College Day, Open House, and ‘Rapture’, our
CCA’s biennial concert. Our CCA has managed to clinch the Certificate of
Distinction for the biennial Singapore Youth Festival from 2013-2019.</p>
<p>Thinking of dancing with us? CCA sessions are held every Tuesday and Wednesday
and we look forward to welcoming anyone with an interest in dance. No prior
dance experience needed!</p>
