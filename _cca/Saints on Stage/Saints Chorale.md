<p>The Saints Chorale is a place that allows each member to nurture a greater
sense of musicality, through singing and performing opportunities. From
sacred to jazz, German to Latin, chorale music covers different music genres
and languages, and we’re here to experience them all!</p>
<p>Regardless of having a musical background or not, we welcome anyone that
has a passion for singing. Our CCA sessions are held on Wednesdays and
Fridays, when you’ll hear our voices ringing around campus.</p>
