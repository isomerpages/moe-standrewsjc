<p>The Malay Cultural Society (MCS) stands as SAJC’s flagship platform for
celebrating Malay heritage and empowering youth leadership. At the heart
of the college’s multicultural vibrancy, MCS inspires students to take
pride in their cultural identity while championing cross-cultural understanding
within the wider community.</p>
<p>Anchored in the Mother Tongue Talent Development Programme, MCS offers
unique opportunities to conceptualize, lead, and showcase impactful initiatives.
Through dynamic in-house programmes, strategic collaborations, and national-level
projects, MCS equips members with confidence, creativity, and leadership
skills to become influential cultural ambassadors.</p>
<p>Signature highlights include the Mother Tongue Fortnight Celebration,
the Mother Tongue Masters Programme, the vibrant Hari Raya Fiesta, and
the national exhibition themed <em>SemangatSG</em>, which showcases the
excellence, resilience, and spirit of Singapore Malay youth.</p>
