<p>The SAJC Environment Club aims to promote sustainable development and
encourage Saints to play their part in caring for the environment. We meet
regularly to discuss environmental issues and prepare for upcoming competitions.
Our CCA achievements include the Singapore Audit Award (Yellow Flame, 2025),
the Sustainability Seeker’s Activity Booklet Challenge (Merit Award, 2025),
and a Bronze Award at the National Youth Upcycling Movement Competition.
Beyond discussions and competitions, we believe in taking action. Our members
actively participate in outdoor environmental initiatives such as the Kallang
River Clean-Up and upcycling webinars.</p>
<p>If you are looking to connect with like-minded individuals who value and
care for the environment we live in, join us on Wednesdays!</p>
