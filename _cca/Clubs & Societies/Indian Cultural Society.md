<p>The SAJC Indian Cultural Society (ICS) consists of three teams: Dance,
Debate and Writing. Members are free to join any section they wish to be
a part of. The Society aims to encourage interest and appreciation of the
complexity and uniqueness of the Tamil language and culture in its members.
It also serves as a platform for members to know more about their cultural
roots, and forge new friendships with their fellow members!</p>
<p>Members of ICS are given the opportunity to participate in various competitions
and workshops, ranging from performance, to debate, and creative writing.
We also educate non-Indian students in College about our culture to promote
social cohesion among different races in SAJC. Our captivating performances
for annual events like Teachers’ Day is just one of the ways we do this!</p>
<p>Want to find out more? Come and meet us every Friday!</p>
