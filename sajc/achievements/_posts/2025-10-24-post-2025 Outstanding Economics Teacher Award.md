<p>For many students, Economics can feel like a subject filled with abstract
theory and complex graphs. But for Mr. Melvin Lim, the goal has always
been clear: to make the subject real, relatable, and relevant.</p>
<p>Winner of the <strong>2025 Outstanding Economics Teacher Award</strong>,
he draws inspiration from helping students see how Economics plays out
in everyday life. Whether it’s why Taylor Swift concert tickets sell out
in seconds or why prices spike on resale platforms, Mr. Lim uses familiar
examples to bring classroom concepts to life.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What inspires me most is seeing students connect theory to the world
around them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
<br>A standout moment in the classroom involved a lesson on firm strategies.
A video showing two cafés locked in a price war sparked laughter, but more
importantly, sparked questions. One student asked, “Is competing on price
the only way?” That led to a deeper conversation about branding, customer
loyalty, and real-world business decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s in these moments of curiosity and connection that real learning
happens.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>
<br>To students pursuing Economics, Mr. Lim offers this advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every market finds its equilibrium. The graphs might look daunting, but
once you connect the dots, everything shifts into place. Keep learning,
keep questioning, and you’ll find your marginal benefit far outweighs your
marginal cost.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond results, Mr. Lim focuses on nurturing critical thinkers who see
the value of Economics not just as a subject, but as a way of understanding
the world.</p>
