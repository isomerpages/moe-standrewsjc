<p>According to Richie Wong Chee How, Class of 2022,<em> “Leadership isn’t about giving orders; it’s about earning trust.”</em>
</p>
<p>From the classroom to the parade square, and from late-night study sessions
to high-stakes operational planning, Richie’s journey through SAJC and
National Service has been defined by determination, adaptability, and a
commitment to serve.</p>
<p>In July 2025, he was awarded NSF of the Year, a prestigious national honour
given to outstanding full-time national servicemen who have demonstrated
excellence in service, leadership, and character. Reflecting on his time
in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Richie shares that it wasn’t a single
moment that defined his NS journey, but rather a series of challenges and
lessons that shaped his growth over time.</p>
<p><em>“I learned that leadership looks different for everyone. With fellow JC grads, respect comes through competence. But with others, it’s about showing up, being real, and being willing to do the hard work with them. You have to earn it differently — and that taught me a lot.”</em>

<h3><strong>Values Rooted in SAJC</strong></h3>
<p>Long before NS, the seeds of leadership were planted during his years
at SAJC. The value of servant leadership, in particular, stood out.</p>

<p><em>“At SA, we were taught to lead by example. That really shaped how I worked during NS. I didn’t want to be the kind of officer who just gives instructions. I wanted to be the one who’s willing to do the ground work too. That’s how you gain trust.”</em>
</p>
<p>The SAJC values of resilience and excellence also carried him through
some of the most physically and mentally challenging moments of his training.
Whether it was late-night operations or difficult field conditions, these
values became the foundation of his approach to leadership and service.</p>

<h3><strong>Words for the Next Generation</strong></h3>
<p>Continuing to lead in his own way, Richie is passionate about sharing
what he’s learned with his juniors. His advice is simple, but powerful:</p>
<p><em>“Don’t wait to feel ready. Just start. Whether it’s NS, studies, or life, your mindset is everything. Some days will be tough, but if you have the right mindset, know why you’re doing it, you’ll get through. You’ll realise your limits aren’t fixed, they can be pushed.”</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>He also reminds students not to base their motivation solely on external
validation.</p>
<p><em>“For me, it was family. I wanted to make them proud. That kept me going. But it’s important to find a motivation that you own — something that can’t be shaken by what others say.”</em>
</p>

<h3><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond NS, Richie continues to pursue his goals with the same energy and
vision. Now studying Data Science and Analytics at the National University
of Singapore, he remains actively involved in student life, sports, and
leadership roles, all while planning for a future grounded in financial
responsibility and service to others.</p>
<p>His story is a powerful reminder that excellence isn’t about perfection.
Excellence is about purpose, persistence, and heart. We are proud to celebrate
his achievements and look forward to the many ways he will continue to
inspire those around him.</p>
