<p>We are proud to celebrate Nguyen Hong Gia Nghi, Class of 2024, as a shining
example of servant leadership, academic excellence, and personal conviction.
Gia Nghi’s experiences in and beyond the college have demonstrated not
only intellectual rigour in the STEM field, but also a deep commitment
to community service — embodying the very spirit of what it means to be
a Saint. As a testament to her passion and diligence, she was awarded the
ASEAN Undergraduate Merit Scholarship and the CDE Masters Award by the
National University of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>From Curiosity to Calling: A Passion for STEM</strong></h3>
<p>Her interest in STEM was first sparked by an inspiring Physics teacher
in secondary school, whose lessons led her to explore quantum physics and
the science behind the materials that shape our world. This early fascination
grew into a passion for <strong>Materials Science and Engineering</strong>,
driven by a desire to understand how nanoscale discoveries translate into
everyday applications — from semiconductors to the very building blocks
of technology.</p>

<p>Determined to deepen her understanding, Gia Nghi took on rigorous enrichment
opportunities such as the <strong>Nanyang Research Programme (NRP)</strong> and
the <strong>A-Level H3 Semiconductor Physics course</strong>. These experiences
affirmed her love for the discipline and her desire to contribute meaningfully
to the field. Her efforts were recognised with a <strong>Gold Award</strong> and
a <strong>Distinction</strong>, further affirming her potential and perseverance.</p>
<h3><strong>A Heart for Service: Starting a Ground-Up Tutoring Programme</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond the classroom, Gia Nghi also made her mark through service. Inspired
by SAJC’s culture of student empowerment, she initiated and led a <strong>peer tutoring programme</strong>,
Saints Tutorly, to support students in need.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“<em>SAJC gave me the space and encouragement to step out of my comfort zone and try something I truly cared about</em>”</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the guidance of <strong>Mr. Sashi</strong>, <strong>Mrs. Joy</strong>,
and later <strong>Ms. Jackina</strong>, and the support of a dedicated team
of student organisers, the project grew to benefit nearly <strong>200 students in its first year</strong>,
and continues to run today — a lasting legacy of her belief in paying it
forward.</p>
<h3><strong>Advice to Aspiring Scholars</strong></h3>
<p>For Saints aspiring to pursue scholarships, Gia Nghi offers grounded advice:</p>
<p><em>“Start by exploring widely — join activities, attend camps, take on projects. Discover what excites you, and go deep into it. With a clear sense of purpose and persistence, you’ll find opportunities that truly fit you. Applying for scholarships isn’t about luck — it’s about knowing what you stand for and having the courage to pursue it.”</em>

<h3><strong>A Saint Who Shines</strong></h3>
<p>Whether in service, scholarship, or scientific pursuit, Gia Nghi exemplifies
the <strong>Qualities of a Saint</strong> — a <strong>holistic thinker</strong>, <strong>community builder</strong>,
and <strong>servant leader</strong> who dares to dream and leads with heart.</p>
<p>We congratulate her on her well-earned achievements and look forward to
the impact she will continue to make in the world of STEM and beyond.</p>
