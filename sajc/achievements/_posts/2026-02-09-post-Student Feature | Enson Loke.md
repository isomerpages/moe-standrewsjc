to render first aid to a person in distress while awaiting the arrival
of emergency medical services.</p>
<p>In a moment of uncertainty, Enzo did not hesitate to act. His calm decisiveness
and willingness to help a person is testament to his exemplary character
and civic mindedness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Enson’s actions serve as a powerful reminder that the values we uphold
are made meaningful when they are put into action.</p>
