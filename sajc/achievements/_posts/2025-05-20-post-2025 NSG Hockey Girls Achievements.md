<p>On 20 May at Sengkang Hockey Stadium, our SAJC Hockey Girls made history
â€“ clinching the championship for the very first time in a hard-fought and
high-energy final against VJC.</p>
<p>The match was a powerful display of skill, heart, and true sportsmanship.
With students from across both levels and staff cheering passionately from
the stands, this win was more than just a trophy â€“ it was a celebration
of team spirit and the unbreakable SA family bond.</p>
<p>ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations to our girls and thank you to everyone who came down
to support!</p>
