<p>The 4th Asian School Rugby Sevens Championship was held in Hong Kong from
8–12 Aug 2025. In this campaign, Singapore's team managed to clinch the
silver medal. We are proud to share that 2 of our Saints were part of the
Singapore team - they are:</p>
<p></p>
<p>🏉 <strong>Goh Kai En Travis</strong> (25A05) and
<br>🏉 <strong>Lim Yih Shao Ashton</strong> (25S11)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The team's result was the culmination of a month of hard work, heartwork
and grit after the grueling National School Games.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Congratulations to both Travis and Ashton for this wonderful achievement!</p>
