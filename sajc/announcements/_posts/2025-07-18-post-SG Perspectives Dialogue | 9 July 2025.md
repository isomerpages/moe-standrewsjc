<p>SG Perspectives is a national engagement platform that allows Pre-University
students to deepen their understanding of Singaporeâ€™s policy landscape.
The session aims to raise awareness of national issues and help students
appreciate the rationale behind key government decisions through direct
dialogue with public office holders.</p>

<br>Over the course of two hours, students engaged actively with SMS Tan,
raising more than 15 thoughtful questions. Discussions revolved around:
<br>ðŸ”¹ Support for vulnerable populations â€“ including eldercare and healthcare
access
<br>ðŸ”¹ AI and digital ethics â€“ focusing on supporting healthcare needs, managing
misinformation, and responsible innovation
<br>ðŸ”¹ Governance and trust â€“ examining the balance between transparency,
regulation, and civil liberties
<br>
<br>It was a valuable opportunity for students to reflect on Singaporeâ€™s present
realities, build a stronger sense of belonging, and express hopes for the
nationâ€™s future.</p>
