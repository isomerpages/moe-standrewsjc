<p>14 July 2025 (Monday) marked another milestone in SAJC’s enduring partnership
with Hangzhou Xiaoshan No. 2 High School! We're delighted to welcome 25
students and 3 staff members from Hangzhou, continuing the meaningful exchange
that began July 2024.</p>

<p>Our partnership has flourished since their first visit, with 29 Saints
visiting Hangzhou in November 2024. This year, we're taking it a step further
- 35 of our Saints from the upcoming China Immersion Programme served as
student ambassadors, each paired with a Hangzhou buddy, for the day.</p>
<p>It was incredible to watch our students step out of their comfort zones.
From Chinese Language students practising their Mandarin to Malay Language
students cleverly using translation apps, the determination to connect
and learn from each other has been inspiring!</p>
<p>These exchanges go far beyond mere cultural exposure - they're about building
lasting connections and understanding. As our Saints prepare for their
year-end immersion in Hangzhou, today's experience has already sparked
excitement and readiness for what's ahead.</p>
<p>To our Hangzhou friends: 欢迎光临! Thank you for being part of our Saints
family! 🤝</p>
