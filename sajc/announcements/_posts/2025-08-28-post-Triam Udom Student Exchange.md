<p>On 22nd August 2025, we had the pleasure of hosting our friends from Thailand
here in Singapore. The day was filled with the spirit of camaraderie and
cross-cultural understanding. Students bonded over a hearty lunch, sharing
stories and aspirations. This was followed by lively Basketball and Football
matches, where friendly competition fostered teamwork and sportsmanship.
The day concluded on a high note with a staff-friendly match, highlighting
the unity and collaboration that extends beyond our students to educators
as well.</p>

open-minded, empathetic, and prepared for a connected world. Our ongoing
partnership stands as a testament to the power of international collaboration
in education.</p>
