<p>On 8 August 2025, our college came together to celebrate Singapore’s 60th
year of independence — a milestone that invites us to reflect not only
on our nation’s achievements, but also on the values that have shaped our
shared journey.</p>
<p>The morning began with a vibrant National Day celebration on campus, graced
by Mayor Denise Phua of the Central Singapore CDC and Mr Alex Yeo, Grassroots
Advisor for Potong Pasir. Their presence underscored the strong partnerships
that have supported our service learning efforts through the years.</p>
<p>From there, our students carried the spirit of the day into Singapore’s
heartlands. Our JC1 cohort embarked on a series of service learning projects
across the island, engaging with various elderly groups to bring warmth,
connection, and care.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our JC2 students marked a special milestone — the 10th year
of our partnership with Central Singapore CDC’s Giraffe’s Project. In true
“giraffe” spirit, they committed acts of kindness and sought out stories
from fellow Singaporeans who have courageously “stuck their necks out”
for the common good.</p>

<p>This annual tradition is more than just a celebration; it is a lived expression
of one of our college’s core qualities — to be community-builders. In serving
others, our Saints are also shaping the future of Singapore, one act of
kindness at a time.</p>
