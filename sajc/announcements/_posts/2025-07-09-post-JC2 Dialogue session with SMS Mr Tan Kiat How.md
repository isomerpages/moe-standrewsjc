<br>Over the course of two hours, students engaged actively with SMS Tan,
raising more than 15 thoughtful questions. Discussions revolved around:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Support for vulnerable populations – including eldercare and healthcare
access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI and digital ethics – focusing on supporting healthcare needs, managing
misinformation, and responsible innovation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governance and trust – examining the balance between transparency, regulation,
and civil liberties
<br>
<br>It was a valuable opportunity for students to reflect on Singapore’s present
realities, build a stronger sense of belonging, and express hopes for the
nation’s future.</p>
