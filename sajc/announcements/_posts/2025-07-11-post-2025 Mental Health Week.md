<p>SAJC’s annual Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing Week took place from 9 to
11 July 2025, bringing students, staff, and alumni together to reflect
on the importance of community and care in maintaining mental wellbeing.</p>
<p>Activities included a Human Library, wellness booths, and hands-on workshops
— all centred on the theme of strengthening connections. The week served
as a powerful reminder that mental wellbeing is not a solitary journey.</p>
<p>Our heartfelt thanks to all participants and partners, especially our
Human Library speakers: <strong>Julian</strong>, <strong>Pak Luen</strong>, <strong>Cassia</strong>, <strong>Germaine</strong>, <strong>William</strong>,
and <strong>Joy</strong>. A special thanks as well to: <strong>Good News Community Services</strong>, <strong>Metropolitan YMCA Singapore</strong>, <strong>Limitless Singapore</strong>, <strong>Fei Yue Community Services (Community Resource Engagement and Support Team)</strong>,
and Singapore Association for <strong>Mental Health (C’SAY CREST-Youth)</strong> for
engaging Saints in the Wellness Roadshow.</p>
