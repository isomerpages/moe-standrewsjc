<p>Dear 2024 JC2 Cohort,</p>
<p>Now that you have received your A level examination results, you may access
the slides from MOE Guidance Branch &amp; ECG Branch&nbsp;for more information
highlighting the different post-secondary pathways, including universities,
polytechnics, and private education.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can learn emotional support strategies through the COPES
framework, helping yourself to manage stress and make rational choices.
It also guides you on supporting your peers using the CHEER method, emphasizing
the importance of empathy and seeking help when needed.</p>
<p>A range of resources, including helplines and career guidance services,
are made available to assist students in navigating their next steps. (File
