<p>On Saturday, 11 October 2025, our Saints had the unique opportunity to
volunteer at the historic launch of the&nbsp;<em>Prominent Malays of Singapore (PMoS)</em>&nbsp;online
portal held at the National Gallery of Singapore. It holds stories of Singapore's
Malay community leaders and changemakers through a new online database
showcasing remarkable individuals who have shaped our nation over the past
60 years.</p>
<p>Dressed in traditional Malay attire, our Saints took on a variety of roles
throughout the event. In addition to their responsibilities, the students
had the memorable experience of interacting and taking photos with distinguished
guests, including the Acting Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs and Senior
Minister of State for Home Affairs, Assoc. Professor Dr Muhammad Faishal
Ibrahim; former President Mdm Halimah Yacob; NLB Chief Executive Mr Ng
Cher Pong; and Dr Azhar Ibrahim, Chairman of the NLB Malay Advisory Panel.
It was an awesome experience for Saints to be part of the Malay community
that inspired them to contribute to uphold this remarkable legacy.

Programme (TDP), offering Saints a rich experiential learning opportunity.
It allowed them to engage directly with the community and meet prominent
figures they might otherwise only see in the media or read about in textbooks.</p>
