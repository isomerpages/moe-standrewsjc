<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level Physics?</strong></h4>
<p>'A' Level Physics builds upon and expands the O-Level foundation with
the dual aim of creating scientifically literate citizens and cultivating
a deep understanding of the discipline. The curriculum is designed to prepare
students for the 21st century by developing the core understanding, skills,
ethics, and attitudes relevant to the Practices of Science. Ultimately,
it fosters the appreciation that a small core set of basic principles and
ideas can be consistently applied to both create useful models and solve
complex problems across diverse physical systems.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is Physics taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p>At SAJC, the teaching of Physics is structured around rich Learning Experiences
to develop deep conceptual understanding, hone the Practices of Science,
and relate science to society and the environment.</p>
<p>This is facilitated through a Blended Learning approach, where the foundational
content is delivered via video lectures to promote self-directed study,
while essential application and reinforcement occur during face-to-face
tutorials focused on problem-solving.</p>
<p>H2 Physics students engage in essential practical work, including analysing
experimental data using spreadsheet software, to acquire critical experimental
and digital competencies.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for Physics?</strong></h4>
<p>Students will need to ensure they have a strong foundation for ‘O’ Level
Physics in order to build new knowledge over that base. It would be essential
for students to approach the subject beyond just memorising equations but
to link physics concepts to real life observations, make logical deduction
based on evidence such as experimental data and communicate using precise
scientific terminology. Students should also hone their problem solving
skills making it explicit for themselves how they analyse a problem, apply
appropriate concepts and make use of mathematical techniques skilfully
to work out the solutions.</p>
