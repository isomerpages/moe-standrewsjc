<p>The SAJC Mentors are members of the college Chaplaincy which provides
pastoral care to the SAJC Community. As mentors, they interact with students
on the ground during daily school activities like PE lessons and CCA sessions.
Along the way, the mentors serve to help and guide Saints through life
in college.</p>
