<p><strong><u>Admission Requirements into Local Universities</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Selection Criteria NUS / NTU / SMU</strong>&nbsp;will select applicants based on their grades in:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>General Paper (GP) or Knowledge and Inquiry (KI)</li>
<li>Project Work (PW)</li>
<li><u>Three</u>&nbsp;H2 and&nbsp;<u>one</u>&nbsp;H1 content-based subjects (at least one of which must be a contrasting subject)</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Besides their examination results, the universities may also consider students’ achievement in other areas, such as Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) and Community Involvement Programme (CIP), as reflected in their School Graduation Certificate (SGC).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>General Requirements for NUS / NTU</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li align="justify">Pass in at least two subjects at H2 Level and offer either General Paper (GP) or Knowledge &amp; Inquiry (KI) in the same sitting.</li>
<li>Meet the Mother Tongue (MT) requirement for admission by having one of the following:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<p align="justify">
		</p><li> a minimum of D7 for the higher MT paper taken at the GCE 'O' Level Examination.<br>
		</li><li> a minimum of ‘S’ grade for the H1 MTL paper or General Studies in Chinese at the GCE ‘A’ Level Examination.<br>
			</li><li> a minimum of 'S' grade for the H2 MTLL paper taken at the GCE 'A' Level Examination.<br>
				</li><li> a pass in the MT 'B' Syllabus paper at the GCE 'A' Level Examination.<p></p>
	</li></ul>
<p align="justify">If a candidate is exempted from MT as approved by MOE, the MOE-approved subject-in-lieu will be considered as the MT subject. Candidates who are unable to fulfil the MT requirement for admission but satisfy all other admission requirements may be admitted on a provisional basis. During their course of study, they will be required to attend the MT course conducted by the University or attain the minimum requirement as listed above by retaking the MT paper at the GCE ‘A’ Level examination before they are allowed to graduate.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>General Requirements for SMU<br></strong>Admissions criteria for applicants under the New Curriculum:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li align="justify">Good passes in at least three H2 subjects, one H1 subject and Project Work</li>
<li align="justify">A good pass in General Paper (GP) or Knowledge &amp; Inquiry (KI). Law applicants must obtain a B and above for GP/KI.</li>
<li>A good pass in Mathematics at H1 level or equivalent</li>
<li align="justify">A minimum of "S" grade in Mother Tongue Language. Successful applicants who have not met the Mother Tongue requirement can still be admitted but must satisfy the requirement before graduating from SMU.</li>
<li>SAT Reasoning Test is optional (but an added advantage for those with strong scores; guideline for strong SAT scores: &gt; 1300 for old SAT format and &gt; 1900 for new SAT format)</li>
<li>Interview (for shortlisted candidates)</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The qualifications listed above for NUS / NTU / SMU are the minimum requirements for consideration in the admission to the undergraduate programmes. It should be appreciated that admission is highly competitive and is based on merit, therefore the possession of minimum requirements does not guarantee admission.</p>
<p><strong><u>Indicative Grade Profile<br></u></strong><strong>Local Universities’ Indicative Grade Profiles for AY 2015/2016</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Every year, the local universities release their Indicative Grade Profiles of their respective courses. This is to provide greater transparency to prospective students for their assessment of which courses they might be eligible for.</p>
<p align="justify">The representative grade profiles of the 10th and 90th percentiles of applicants holding Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level qualifications and were offered places in AY 2014/2015 are published on their websites. The grade profiles refer to the grades scored in the 3 H2 and 1 H1 subjects.</p>
<p align="justify">The number of course places taken up in AY 2014/2015 is also available. The respective numbers are subject to change from year to year.</p>
<p align="justify">Applicants can expect competition to be keener for courses with more stringent grade requirements and fewer places.</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li align="justify">The grade profiles and course places may vary from year to year, depending on the number and performance of applicants and the number of places available.</li>
<li align="justify">Meeting the previous year’s grade of a course does not guarantee admission to that course in the subsequent year.</li>
<li>Some courses require additional assessments such as interviews, selection tests, and portfolios.</li>
<li>Some may also have specific subject requirements.</li>
