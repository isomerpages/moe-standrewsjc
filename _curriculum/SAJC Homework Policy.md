<p>Homework, when used appropriately, can reinforce students’ learning, provide
feedback on their progress and cultivate a healthy disposition towards
continual learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While homework can be beneficial, excessive homework can have an adverse
impact on students’ holistic development and well-being, and can also negatively
affect their motivation for learning. Therefore, the amount of homework
is carefully calibrated and outlined in this document. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Definition of Homework</h3>
<p>Homework refers to any learning activity that schools require students
to complete outside of curriculum time, regardless of the mode of delivery
(i.e. pen-and-paper, virtual/ online).&nbsp; This includes assignments
and projects and&nbsp;<u>excludes revision of school work, studying for tests and examinations or watching lecture videos.</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>
<p><strong>Teachers should:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Design homework assignments that are purposeful, relevant to class instruction,
and encourage critical thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure homework instructions are clear and concise so students fully understand
expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider students' age, abilities, and developmental readiness when assigning

assignments, teachers should exercise flexibility, provide appropriate
assistance, and engage in conversations with parents where necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Students should:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">

clarification from various resources when facing difficulties, and consistently

apply those insights to future assignments, seeking clarification when
needed and reflecting on the feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use digital tools and resources ethically and responsibly when completing
homework, ensuring academic integrity and minimising distractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proactively communicate with their teachers and request for homework deadline
extensions during busy periods, fostering responsibility and time management
skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strive to maintain a healthy balance between academic work and personal
well-being, ensuring adequate rest and recreational activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

activities, and help their children prioritise their time among these activities;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work in partnership with the school and teachers to support their children’s
learning and development. This includes communicating any concerns about
their children's ability to manage the workload and collaborating with
the school to develop effective strategies for their children's success.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3>Guidelines for Homework during School Term and Holidays</h3>

in recognition of the varying abilities among students.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the context of Home-Based Learning (HBL) days, the recommended number
of hours for curriculum coverage per day (i.e. 4 – 5 hours for JC/CI) includes
time for completion of homework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>School holidays are meant for students to take a break from formal learning
and they should therefore not be given excessive homework.&nbsp; For school
holidays, the daily homework load will not be more than 50% of the daily
load given during the school week.</p>
