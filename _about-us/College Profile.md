<p><strong>Introduction:</strong>
</p>
<p>St Andrew's Junior College (SAJC) has its origins in St Andrew's School,
which was founded in 1862 by the Anglican Diocese of Singapore. SAJC is
an aided mission school which was started by the Anglican, Lutheran and
Presbyterian Churches in 1978.</p>
<p>SAJC offers a two-year co-education to the top students who had completed
their Singapore-Cambridge General Certification of Education (GCE) at Ordinary
‘O’ level (the equivalent to Year 10). The College prepares these students
for the Singapore-Cambridge General Certification of Education at Advanced
‘A’ level.</p>
<p>The College’s vision is to be a Home of Servant Leaders who bring life
to the Nations. The College believes in nurturing Saints who are principled
servant-leaders, upholding the WISE1 and TRUE2 values that define who we
are and how we act.</p>
<p>Besides attaining academic success, its students also excel in the Co-Curricular
Activities. Many of the sports regularly attain the top 4 positions at
the national championship competitions. The performing arts groups also
clinch distinction awards at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.
In addition, the students make an indelible impact in serving the less
fortunate and needy members of the communities, both locally and overseas.
All in all, its students enjoy a high-quality education during their years
in the College.</p>
