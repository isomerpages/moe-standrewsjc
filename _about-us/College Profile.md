<p><strong>Introduction:</strong>
</p>
<p>St Andrew's Junior College (SAJC) has its origins in St Andrew's School,
which was founded in 1862 by the Anglican Diocese of Singapore. SAJC is
an aided mission school which was started by the Anglican, Lutheran and
Presbyterian Churches in 1978.</p>
<p>SAJC offers a two-year co-education to the top students who had completed
their Singapore-Cambridge General Certification of Education (GCE) at Ordinary
‘O’ level (the equivalent to Year 10). The College prepares these students
for the Singapore-Cambridge General Certification of Education at Advanced
‘A’ level.</p>
<p>The College’s vision is to be a Home of Servant Leaders who bring life
to the Nations. The College believes in nurturing Saints who are principled
servant-leaders, upholding the WISE<sup>1</sup> and TRUE<sup>2</sup> values
that define who we are and how we act when we stand together as a village.</p>
<p>Besides attaining academic success, its students also excel in the Co-Curricular
Activities. Many of the sports regularly attain the top 4 positions at
the national championship competitions. The performing arts groups also
clinch distinction awards at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.
In addition, the students make an indelible impact in serving the less
fortunate and needy members of the communities, both locally and overseas.
All in all, its students enjoy a high-quality education during their years
in the College.</p>

<p><strong>Tutors:</strong>

<p><u>Civics Tutor:</u> The Civics Tutor is the teacher who would know his/her
student best. He/ She is the equivalent of the home/ form teacher. The
Civics Tutor usually tutors the student for at least one subject, will
also compile the student’s academic and other records. The Civics Tutor
caters to the pastoral needs of the students and is generally the first
person to refer to when a detailed testimonial is needed. Every class also
has a Civics Tutor Advisor, who lends support in caring for the students’
well-being.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Subject Tutors:</u> Subject Tutors teach the students of the class in
the respective subjects. In the event that the Civics Tutor has left the
College, the College will then refer to Subject Tutors' comments documented
in the student's file.</p>
